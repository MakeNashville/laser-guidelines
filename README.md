# Weekly Tasks

## Cleaning the Focus Lens

**Time:** 2-3 minutes  

### Materials Needed:
- Lens cleaning solution (optical grade)
- Lint-free wipes or lens tissue
- Compressed air (optional)

### Procedure:

1. **Power off the laser** and wait for any movement to stop.

2. **Access the lens:**
   - The focus lens is located in the laser head/nozzle assembly
   - Unscrew or unclip the lens holder
   - Carefully remove the lens, noting which side faces up
     - Hold lens by edges only – **never** touch optical surfaces   

3. **Clean the lens:**
   - Use compressed air to remove loose dust first (optional)
   - Fold a lint-free wipe and apply 2-3 drops of lens cleaning solution
   - Place lens on clean surface or hold carefully
   - Wipe in gentle circular motion, starting from center
   - Use a fresh section of wipe for each pass
   - Repeat until lens is clean

4. **Inspect the lens:**
   - Hold up to light at an angle
   - Look for scratches, pitting, or cloudiness
   - Check for burn marks around edges
   - If damaged, set aside and use spare lens

5. **Reinstall:**
   - Ensure lens is completely dry
   - Note: Curved side typically faces UP (toward the beam)
   - Secure lens holder but don't overtighten

### Warning Signs (Replace Lens):
- Visible scratches in coating
- Burn marks or discoloration
- Cloudy or hazy appearance
- Chipped edges

## Cleaning the Mirrors

**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Frequency:** Weekly (minimum)

### Mirror Locations:
- **Mirror 1:** Rear left corner, receives beam from tube
- **Mirror 2:** On left side of the gantry (moves with Y axis)
- **Mirror 3:** On laser head (moves with X axis)

### Procedure:

1. **Power off the laser.**

2. **For each mirror:**
   - Apply lens cleaning solution to lint-free wipe
   - Gently wipe mirror surface in circular motion
   - Do NOT press hard – mirrors are front-surface coated
   - Use fresh wipe section for each mirror

3. **Inspect each mirror:**
   - Look for burn spots, pitting, or coating damage
   - Check that mirror is secure in mount
   - Note any damage for repair log

### Important Notes:
- Never spray solution directly on mirrors
- Never touch mirror surface with fingers
- Don't adjust mirror mounts unless trained in alignment
- Mirrors are typically gold or silicon coated

## Emptying the Debris Tray  
**Time:** 1-2 minutes  

### Procedure:

1. **Remove debris tray:**
   - Slide out tray from beneath honeycomb bed
   - Dispose of material scraps appropriately
   - Wipe tray if needed
  
2. **Replace debris tray.**


## Check the Water Cooling System

**Time:** 1 minute  
**Frequency:** Weekly

### Procedure:

1. **Check water level:**
   - Look at level gauge on the back of the reservoir/chiller
   - Water should be at or above minimum line
   - Add DISTILLED water only if low

2. **Verify flow:**
   - Look for flow indicator (Do we have this?)
   - Listen for pump operation
   - Feel return line – should be slightly warm after using the laser
  
3. **Check water quality:**
   - Water should be clear
   - No cloudiness, green tint, or particles
   - No algae growth
   - If water appears contaminated, perform Full Coolant Replacement before using the laser

### Warning: Never operate laser if:
- Water level is low
- Pump is not running
- Water appears contaminated


## Check Belt Tension

**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Frequency:** Weekly

### Procedure:

1. **Locate belts:**
   - X-axis belt runs left-right
   - Y-axis belt(s) run front-back

2. **Check tension:**
   - Press belt with finger at midpoint
   - Should deflect approximately 5mm (1/4 inch)
   - Belt should feel taut but not guitar-string tight

3. **Listen test:**
   - Move gantry manually
   - Listen for any unusual sounds
   - Check for smooth motion

4. **If adjustment needed:**
   - Note the issue in maintenance log
   - Belt tensioning may require experienced member
   - Don't over-tighten (causes wear)

## Clean Air Assist Nozzle

**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Frequency:** Weekly

### Procedure:

1. **Remove nozzle** from laser head.

2. **Clean interior:**
   - Use compressed air to blow out debris
   - Use pipe cleaner for stuck material
   - Check for clogs in air passage

3. **Check air line:**
   - Trace line from nozzle back to pump
   - Check for kinks or damage
   - Verify connections are secure

4. **Test air flow:**
   - Reconnect nozzle
   - Turn on air assist
   - Feel for air at nozzle tip

# Monthly Tasks

---

## Clean and Lubricate Guide Rails

**Time:** 15 minutes  
**Frequency:** Monthly

### Materials:
- **White lithium grease** (per OMTech recommendation)
- Disposable cloths or paper towels

### Procedure:

1. **Power off machine.**

2. **Clean rails first:**
   - With a clean hand, drag the gantry to one corner of the machine
   - Use disposable cloth to wipe X-axis and Y-axis guide rails
   - Remove ALL old grease and debris from top and bottom of rails
   - Rails should be completely clean
    > NOTE: Clean and lubricate only the exposed parts of the rails, then drag the gantry to the opposite corner of the machine to access the sections of the rails that were covered by the gantry. We want to clean & lubricate the entire range of motion

3. **Apply white lithium grease:**
   - Apply a **small amount** to each guide rail
   - Spread it out along the top and bottom of the rail with your fingertip
   - Avoid getting grease on the rubber belt
   - ⚠️ **Do not over-lubricate!** A little goes a long way
   - Over-lubrication traps dust and accelerates wear

4. **Distribute grease:**
   - With a clean hand, slowly pull the gantry back and forth along the applied grease
   - Cover full range of motion on X and Y axes

5. **Lubricate bed screws:**
   - Wipe the 4 bed screws clean
   - Apply small amount of white lithium grease
   - Move bed up and down to distribute

6. **Remove excess:**
   - Wipe away any excess grease
   - You should have only a light film remaining

## Check Mirror Alignment

**Time:** 15-30 minutes  
**Frequency:** Monthly

### Materials:
- Masking tape or thermal paper
- Safety glasses

### Procedure:

1. **Prepare for test:**
   - Power on machine
   - Home all axes

2. **Test Mirror 2:**
   - Place tape on Mirror 2
   - Fire single low-power pulse (~10%)
   - Check burn mark is centered on mirror

3. **Test Mirror 3:**
   - Place tape on Mirror 3
   - Fire pulse at front-left of bed
   - Fire pulse at front-right of bed
   - Both marks should be in same position

4. **Test at lens:**
   - Remove lens
   - Place tape over lens opening
   - Fire pulse at all four corners of bed
   - Marks should all be centered

5. **If misaligned:**
   - Note which mirror needs adjustment
   - Contact experienced member for alignment
   - Do not attempt if untrained
