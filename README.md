   - The focus lens is located in the laser head/nozzle assembly
   - Unscrew or unclip the lens holder
   - Carefully remove the lens, noting which side faces up
     - Hold lens by edges only – **never** touch optical surfaces   

3. **Clean the lens:**
   - Use compressed air to remove loose dust first (optional)
   - Fold a lint-free wipe and apply 2-3 drops of lens cleaning solution
   - Place lens on clean surface or hold carefully
   - Wipe in gentle circular motion, starting from center
   - Use a fresh section of wipe for each pass
   - Repeat until lens is clean

4. **Inspect the lens:**
   - Hold up to light at an angle
   - Look for scratches, pitting, or cloudiness
   - Check for burn marks around edges
   - If damaged, set aside and use spare lens

5. **Reinstall:**
   - Ensure lens is completely dry
   - Note: Curved side typically faces UP (toward the beam)

## Clean and Lubricate Guide Rails

**Time:** 15 minutes
**Frequency:** Every 2 weeks (per OMTech)

### Materials:
- **White lithium grease** (per OMTech recommendation)
- Disposable cloths or paper towels
- Lint-free cloths

### Procedure:

1. **Power off machine.**

2. **Clean rails first:**
   - Use disposable cloth to wipe X-axis and Y-axis guide rails

   - Move gantry using arrow keys to work in the grease
   - Cover full range of motion on X and Y axes

5. **Lubricate bed screws:**
   - Wipe the 4 bed screws clean
   - Apply small amount of white lithium grease
   - Move bed up and down to distribute
